A run-and-gun sidescroller made for my grade 12 computer science final project. It features endless randomly                               generated terrain made using Perlin and Simplex noise, a completely destructible environment and plenty of enemies                      to shoot. You can even play with your friends with local multiplayer. It was made using Java and Swing.
